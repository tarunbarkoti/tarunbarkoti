# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Tarun Barkoti

Iâ€™m a data engineer, software developer and AI/ML innovator who builds things that make a difference â€” From scalable data pipelines to full-stack web apps, I work at the intersection of data and development, turning complex ideas into usable, impactful solutions. I have expertise in developing production-grade dashboards, automating complex workflows, and engineering scalable data systems. With a solid foundation in Python, R, Javascript, php and modern web technologies, I focus on solving real-world challenges by combining backend precision with clean, user-centric interfaces.

I'm also the creator and co-founder of **DevArc** â€” a growing commumity which provides various platforms empowering developers to share, collaborate, and level up through real-world projects and technical storytelling.
