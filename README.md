# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Tarun Barkoti

I'm a data engineer and full-stack developer currently working at **THSTI**, where I build production-ready dashboards, automate clinical research workflows, and manage large-scale biomedical data systems. With a background in **Python, R, SQL, and web technologies**, I love solving real-world data problems by bridging backend logic with clean, usable interfaces.

Iâ€™m also an active contributor to **Devarc**, a growing developer community focused on peer-driven upskilling, AI experimentation, and open collaboration.
